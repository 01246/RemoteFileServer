Systems Programming
Asst3: Remote Files
Stephen Petrides
Andrew Macneille

A client opens a single socket in netserverinit() and uses the global sockfd, initialized in netserverinit() for all net____() function calls. On the server side, this means that each client is one socket and one thread.

netread() assumes that the buffer has valid address with enough room
